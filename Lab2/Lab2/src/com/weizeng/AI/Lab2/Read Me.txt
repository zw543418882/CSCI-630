Step 1:
Use javac *.java to compile all java files
Step 2:
Use java Wiki to execute the program
Step 3:
Use train dt/ds 10/20/30 to complete the process of training
(dt is decision tree, ds is decision stump, 10/20/30 stands for the number of words of training file)
(Example: train dt 50)
Step 4:
Use predict fileName.txt to make a decision about the type of language in the txt file 
(Example: predict test.txt)

(You can use train dt 10/20/50 and train ds 10/20/50 alternately to change the model)
